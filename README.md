---> Overview:
- Designed a documentary and UML diagrams of a new software\application developing process called TimeTact.
- Writing every needed details such as description, vision, requierements, scenario, use cases, use case documents and etc
- Created a complete Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for a new application (TimeTact) as part of a software engineering project.
- Defined system objectives, functional & non-functional requirements, detailed scenarios, and use-case descriptions.
